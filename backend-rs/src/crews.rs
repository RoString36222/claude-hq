//! HQ 2.1 crews, ported from `app/crews.py` and `app/routes/crews.py`.
//!
//! Create a crew (name, short tag, banner colour), share its private invite
//! code, and climb the crew board together. A crew's XP is its members'
//! combined XP -- session XP plus game XP, scored exactly as progression does
//! -- one crew per person, up to `MAX_MEMBERS`. When the owner leaves, the
//! longest-standing remaining member takes over; the last one out closes the
//! crew.
//!
//! PRIVACY: the invite code is the one field here that is not public. It goes
//! out only to someone who is already inside the crew (`/mine`) or who just
//! got in (`/create`, `/join`), which is why `CrewOut.code` is an `Option` that
//! is *omitted* rather than nulled -- the Python asserts `"code" not in
//! board[0]`, and an explicit `null` would already be a leak of shape. The
//! lookup in `/join` is gated on the code's shape before any query runs, and a
//! malformed code and an unknown one return the identical 404, so nothing in
//! this module tells a prober which codes exist.
