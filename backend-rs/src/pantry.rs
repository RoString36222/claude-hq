//! Poke Coins, the pantry and gifts, ported from `app/pantry.py` and
//! `app/routes/pantry.py`.
//!
//! Coins and food are cosmetic: nothing here touches XP, scoring, daily_stats
//! or the board. The store's stock follows the UTC season and one in-stock food
//! a day is the special, a coin off; both are pure functions of the date
//! (`season_of`, `special_of`), so they need no storage and every server and
//! client agrees all day. Every write is one transaction in a fixed order:
//!
//! 1. the journal INSERT into `poke_ledger`. It is the FIRST write, so SQLite's
//!    deferred `BEGIN` takes the database write lock here, and the row claims
//!    the request id under UNIQUE(user_id, request_id);
//! 2. the daily cap counts, which are exact because they run under that lock and
//!    include the row just inserted;
//! 3. conditional debits (`WHERE qty >= n`);
//! 4. conditional credits (`WHERE qty + n <= cap`);
//! 5. commit.
//!
//! There are no savepoints. Any refused guard rolls the whole thing back, the
//! journal row included, so a retry with the same request id re-executes once
//! the caller has topped up; a request id that already committed replays its
//! result instead of spending twice. CHECK(qty >= 0) is only the backstop --
//! the caps live in those WHERE clauses, so they can change without a rebuild.
//!
//! Nothing in this module carries a session id, title, path, URL, command,
//! project name or prompt text, and every request body is `extra="forbid"`, so
//! a stray one is a 422 rather than a quiet accept.

// each site here has to pick the right one:
//
//   * a Pydantic validation failure -- a missing field, a wrong type, a failed
//     constraint, a bad Literal, an `extra="forbid"` violation, or a
//     `model_validator` raising -- reaches app/main.py's `_scrub_422` and comes
//     back as a LIST of `{loc, msg, type}`. That is everything below, and the
//     `msg`/`type` strings are pydantic-core's own;
//   * an explicit `raise HTTPException(422, "...")` in the route comes back as
//     a bare string. `do_reward`'s "reward amount does not match the catalog"
//     is the only one in this module, and it stays a string.
//
// The constraint order is Pydantic's too: min_length, then max_length, then
// pattern, at most one error per field; the declared fields are reported before
// the unknown keys; and the `model_validator(mode="after")` cross-field rules
// run only once every field has passed.
