//! HQ 2.1 progression, leaderboards and trainer profiles, ported from
//! `app/results.py` and `app/routes/progress.py`.
//!
//! Three read-only routes. Nothing here is submitted by a client: a level, a
//! streak, a trophy and a board position are all derived on the spot from
//! `daily_stats` (what the stats ingest recorded) and `game_results` (what the
//! Arena itself wrote when a game ended). There is no INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE
//! in this module and so no transaction either -- the only write in the request
//! path is `devices.last_seen_at`, done by main.rs's `require_device`.
//!
//! The privacy boundary: a profile and a board carry derived counts, equipped
//! cosmetics and a crew's tag. Never a cost, a token count, a GitHub id, a
//! device, an email, a crew's invite code, or anything from a transcript.
