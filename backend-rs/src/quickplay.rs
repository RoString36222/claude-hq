//! Quick Play (HQ 2.1): matchmaking across rooms, per game. A port of
//! `backend/app/quickplay.py` and `backend/app/routes/quickplay.py`.
//!
//! Queue for a game; the Arena groups people into a fresh room ("qp_<id>") and
//! tells each of them where to go. Crewmates are put together first, then
//! whoever has waited longest. A match forms as soon as [`MAX_GROUP`] are
//! waiting, or once the oldest has waited [`WAIT_SECS`] with at least one other
//! person in the queue.
//!
//! Three things are worth knowing before changing anything here.
//!
//! *Matchmaking is poll-driven, not timer-driven.* [`expire`] and [`form`] run
//! only inside `status` -- and `join` ends by calling `status`, which is why the
//! eighth joiner for a game is matched by their own POST. Any one user's poll
//! advances the state machine for all five games and every waiting user. There
//! is deliberately no background sweeper: adding one would change *when* groups
//! form relative to the Python and break the clock-stepping tests.
//!
//! *All the state is in memory and process-local*, exactly as in the Python:
//! module globals in one Arena process, no table, no migration. A restart drops
//! every queue, match and room entitlement, and clients fall back to `idle` on
//! their next poll. A second Arena process would be a second, disjoint
//! matchmaker. It lives in a static rather than on `AppState` because it is
//! this module's own business and nothing else reads it.
//!
//! *The responses carry counts, never people.* No handle, display name, user
//! id, avatar or crew appears in any of the three bodies -- only a queue size,
//! a group size, the opaque room id and the game key. The crew id read from the
//! database is used to sort the grouping and is then discarded. The lobby
//! websocket is where identities legitimately appear, after admission.

// admits/room_info are the websocket route's half of this feature; main.rs has
// not been wired to call them yet (another agent owns that file), and the
// constants are the vocabulary the tests and that route read.
