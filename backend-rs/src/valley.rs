//! The shared Valley layer: the catalogs, the outbox, the per-game lobby, the
//! one room-state object, the dispatcher, the flush, the disconnect path and the
//! per-room tick loops. A port of the game-agnostic half of
//! `backend/app/valley.py` -- GAMES/PROTOCOL/GAME_NAMES (:59-80),
//! `season_of`/`_clip` (:249-255), `Out` (:258-284), `Lobby` (:287-298),
//! `RoomValley`/`_rooms`/`valley_for` (:301-325), `_today` (:896), `_rng`
//! (:993), `handle` (:997-1151), `_golf_recheck_later`/`golf_recheck`
//! (:1495-1525), `_leave_lobby` (:1527-1573), `on_disconnect` (:1575-1589),
//! `_send_quiet` (:1592-1597) and `_flush` (:1599-1633).
//!
//! WHY THIS IS ONE MODULE AND NOT NINE HUBS. The Python has one dispatcher and
//! one `RoomValley` per room holding all eleven lobbies. kart.rs, platformer.rs
//! and fps.rs each reimplemented that layer, and the three copies are the same
//! code three times (`flush` is byte-identical in all three, comment text
//! included). Nine more games would make twelve copies and twelve state maps.
//! More importantly, the only reason this port exists is wire parity, and the
//! only cheap way to audit wire parity is for a reviewer to put valley.py and
//! valley.rs side by side and see the same branches in the same order. So the
//! shapes here are Python's shapes, even where idiomatic Rust would differ:
//! [`Lobby::members`] is an insertion-ordered `Vec` because Python's dict order
//! reaches the wire; [`Out`] is a list of (audience, payload) pairs rather than
//! a typed event enum; [`RoomValley`] is one wide struct rather than per-game
//! maps; the dispatcher is one long `match` rather than a registry of handlers;
//! and Python's `if g == "hq"` special cases stay AT the dispatch site
//! ([`cap`], [`room_gate`]) instead of moving into the engine, so a reviewer can
//! still find them.
//!
//! WHAT IS NOT HERE YET, and who adds it. This file is phase 0 of the fan-out:
//! the shared layer alone, with nothing wired to it. Nine engines (pond, race,
//! duel, mines, farm, golf, hq, type and party) land next, each as its own
//! `src/valley/<game>.rs`, and each touches this file in exactly three places:
//! [`ValleyHub::joined_tail`] (the join snapshot), [`ValleyHub::engine_op`] (the
//! per-game ops) and [`engine_dropped`] (the leave branch). Those three
//! signatures are the frozen contract; everything else here is finished.
//! `RoomValley` grows one named field per engine, in Python's `__init__` order.
//! main.rs's wiring (an `AppState` field, the routing arms and the
//! `on_disconnect` call) is the integrator's commit, not this one.
//!
//! kart, plat and fps keep their own hubs and their own private copies of this
//! layer, including their own `Lobby`/`Out`/`To`, `MAX_LOBBY`, `HOST_GRACE`,
//! `as_num` and `cm`. That duplication is deliberate and temporary: those three
//! work, are covered by 2,536 lines of tests that pin event ORDER as well as
//! contents, and are the Arena's only live real-time games. They migrate one at
//! a time, each its own commit with `cargo test <game>::` green before and
//! after, once these nine have exercised this dispatcher. Deleting their copies
//! belongs to those commits. See the note on [`ValleyHub`].
//!
//! THE SHARED DIVERGENCES FROM PYTHON, LISTED ONCE SO NINE ENGINE FILES CAN
//! POINT AT THIS INSTEAD OF EACH INVENTING A WORDING:
//!   1. `now()` is read ONCE per message and passed down. Python calls `now()`
//!      up to six times inside the join arm alone and could in principle see
//!      different values; with a monotonic clock the difference is
//!      unobservable. kart.rs already made this choice.
//!   2. No Rust port can reproduce CPython's Mersenne Twister, so no seeded
//!      Python sequence is reproducible. Port the DISTRIBUTION, drop the
//!      seeded-oracle tests, assert the properties the Python test asserts (a
//!      5-letter word from the list, a fish whose rarity is in the table, n
//!      distinct holes in play order), and say so at the call site. See [`Dice`].
//!   3. [`SEND_TIMEOUT`] has no equivalent. Python caps one socket at 0.5 s for
//!      a lobby fan-out and gathers the rest concurrently under a shield;
//!      `rooms::send_where` is a non-blocking `try_send` on bounded queues, so a
//!      socket that cannot keep up drops the frame instead of being waited on.
//!   4. [`ValleyHub::flush`] uses `Recorder::record_later` (which spawns) where
//!      Python `await`s `resultsmod.record`. Pre-existing, documented at
//!      results.rs.
//!   5. Python appends party's message to `out.items` WHILE iterating that same
//!      list (valley.py:1610), so it goes out after everything already queued.
//!      A Rust by-value `for` cannot pick that up, so when party lands its
//!      message is collected during the loop and sent after it -- "last in this
//!      flush", not "right after the done".
//!   6. The three places Python awaits mid-dispatch are deferred to after the
//!      state guard drops. See [`After`].
//!   7. `on_disconnect`'s early return compares conn ids where Python compares
//!      WebSocket identity (valley.py:1577), and its room teardown stops this
//!      room's tick loops outright where Python lets each step notice the
//!      valley is gone and return False on its next tick.
//!   8. Python walks all eleven games in GAMES order in `on_disconnect`, putting
//!      kart/plat/fps 7th/8th/9th; here main.rs will call the three hubs first
//!      and this one after, so a socket watching several games sees the GAMES in
//!      a different inter-game order. Nothing within a game moves, because each
//!      flush addresses different sockets. It resolves itself when those three
//!      migrate.
//!
//! AUDIENCE IS THE EASIEST THING TO GET WRONG IN THESE NINE PORTS, and it fails
//! silently: no error, no panic, a passing engine test, and frames that simply
//! stop reaching people. kart, plat and fps -- the only Rust models an author
//! can copy from -- send almost everything to `To::Users(lobby_ids, None)`.
//! pond, race, duel, mines, farm and party send almost everything to [`To::All`]:
//! the WHOLE ROOM, including sockets that never joined that game's lobby, and
//! `test_duel_non_participants_cannot_act` depends on it. Each engine module's
//! header must state its own rule in one line, and each test file must carry one
//! `..._goes_to_the_whole_room` or `..._goes_only_to_the_lobby` test.

// Nothing calls this module yet. main.rs only declares it (`mod valley;`); the
// hub's wiring and the nine engine files land in later commits, and until then
// the whole file is unreachable from the binary. Rather than 40 targeted allows
// that all say the same thing, one module-wide allow with this comment, the way
// kart.rs:30 and realtime.rs:23 justify theirs. It comes off when main.rs
// constructs the hub; the engine agents never need to touch it.
// Deliberately NO module-wide `#![allow(dead_code)]`. It covered the nine
// engine files too (a lint attribute nests), which would have hidden an
// unreachable function in any of 12,000 new lines. Everything unused here is
// allowed item by item, with its reason.

// The nine engines. Each is one file and touches nothing outside it; the three
// hooks below, the party short-circuit, the farm tail and golf's two grace
// questions are the whole of their contact with this file.
