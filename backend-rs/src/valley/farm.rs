//! The shared farm. The only Valley game that touches the database.
//!
//! A port of `backend/app/valley.py`'s farm half: `CROPS` (:102-106),
//! `FARM_PLOTS`/`FARM_SEEDS_PER_DAY` (:107-108), `_farm_load` (:900),
//! `_water` (:915), `_farm_view` (:924) and `farm_op` (:942). `_today` and
//! `season_of` are already in the shared layer as [`super::today`] and
//! [`super::season_of`], reached here through `hub.today()`.
//!
//! The farm keeps NO [`super::RoomValley`] state -- Python's `RoomValley` has no
//! farm attribute either. One JSON document per room lives in `room_farms.data`
//! and the water is read out of `daily_stats` on every view, never stored. So
//! there is no `Farm` struct, no `joined`, no `op` and no `dropped`: the shared
//! layer routes the join snapshot (as `{"op": "view"}`) and every farm op to the
//! one entry point [`run`] through [`super::After::Farm`], with the state guard
//! dropped, which is the only reason this file may await.
//!
//! AUDIENCE. `note` and `farm` go to [`super::To::All`] -- the WHOLE ROOM,
//! including sockets that never joined the farm lobby. Only the four errors and
//! the `harvest` receipt go to the one socket. Pinned by
//! `the_farm_view_goes_to_the_whole_room`.
//!
//! The shared divergences from Python are listed once at the top of
//! `backend-rs/src/valley.rs`; this file's own are marked DIVERGENCE below.
