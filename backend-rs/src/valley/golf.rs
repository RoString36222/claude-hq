//! Mini Golf for the Valley (g = "golf"): deterministic integer putting physics
//! and the round referee. A port of `backend/app/golf.py` in full plus the golf
//! branch of `backend/app/valley.py` (`golf_op` :1429-1479, `_golf_advance`
//! :1482-1492, the join tail :1049-1054 and the `_leave_lobby` arm :1562-1566).
//!
//! AUDIENCE: every golf event goes to THIS GAME'S LOBBY (`out.lobby`), or to the
//! one asking socket (`view`, every error, and a join that did not restore a
//! parked player). Never [`super::To::All`] -- unlike pond, race, duel, mines
//! and farm, a socket in the room that never joined golf sees no golf traffic at
//! all, which `test_round_over_websockets` depends on (test_golf.py:318-325) and
//! `a_golf_event_goes_only_to_the_lobby` pins here.
//!
//! The physics is integer-only so the server and every browser compute exactly
//! the same roll: the server simulates each shot from {ax, az, power} and
//! broadcasts the result, and the clients replay the same simulation
//! (games/golf.js, between the GOLF-SIM markers) only to animate it. Keep the
//! three in lock-step. `backend/tests/golf_golden.json` pins 350 shots across
//! all five courses and `the_golden_vectors_roll_exactly_as_python_does` drives
//! that same file, so a divergence of one unit in one substep fails here.
//!
//! Units: 1 tile = 10000. Velocity is units/tick x [`VS`], [`TICK`] ticks per
//! second. Courses come from `backend/app/golf_courses.json`, embedded with
//! `include_str!` -- the same file the Python reads (itself a byte copy of
//! games/golf/courses.json), so there is no third copy to drift, exactly as
//! kart.rs:75 and fps.rs:121 do it.
//!
//! Rules: [`tdiv`] truncates toward zero, [`super::isqrt`] floors; no floats
//! anywhere in [`simulate`]. Moving obstacles (windmill blades, sliding gates)
//! are functions of the shot clock: the client sends the phase it putted at
//! ("clk", 0..[`CLOCK`]-1) and both sides roll from it.
//!
//! Golf is TURN-BASED and never reaches realtime.rs: its only timer is
//! [`super::After::GolfRecheck`], the one-shot the shared layer arms from
//! `on_disconnect` and from itself while [`grace_left`] is Some.
//!
//! The shared divergences from Python (one clock read per message, no seeded
//! RNG oracle, `SEND_TIMEOUT`, the deferred tail) are listed once at the top of
//! `backend-rs/src/valley.rs`; this file does not repeat them. Its own are
//! marked DIVERGENCE at the site.
