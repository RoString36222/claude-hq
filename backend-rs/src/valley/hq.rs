//! Live presence in an HQ and in Arena City (`g = "hq"`): who is in the room
//! right now, and where they stand.
//!
//! A port of backend/app/hqpresence.py in full, plus the four places
//! backend/app/valley.py reaches into it -- the join tail (:1067-1070), the
//! `pos` op (:1136-1138), the loop `_hq_tick_on` (:1271-1287) and the leave
//! branch (:1558-1559).
//!
//! Each HQ has its own Arena room, `hq_<owner user id>`; Arena City, the street
//! of open HQs, is one more room, `hq_city`. Everyone in either joins the "hq"
//! lobby and sends where they stand: which floor, x/z in centimetres, facing in
//! degrees, and whether they walk. The room's loop sends the whole list 8 times
//! a second, so everyone sees everyone else move. Positions only: no session
//! data, and nothing is stored (hqpresence.py:1-9).
//!
//! THE AUDIENCE RULE, in one line (see the audience note at the top of
//! `super`): the join `snap` goes to the ONE socket that joined (`out.to`,
//! valley.py:1069), and every ticked `snap` goes only to the hq LOBBY
//! (`out.lobby(list(v.lobbies["hq"].members), ..)`, valley.py:1283) -- never to
//! the whole room, so a socket sitting in an `hq_` room that never sent `join`
//! learns nothing about anybody.
//!
//! hq emits NO error of its own. The two a client can provoke are the
//! dispatcher's, not this file's: "HQ presence lives in an HQ room" at
//! [`super::room_gate`] and "this game's lobby is full" at [`super::cap`]. A
//! `pos` that fails every rule is answered with silence -- the next snapshot
//! simply still shows the old position.
//!
//! WHAT THE SHARED LAYER ALREADY DOES, so this file does not do it twice:
//! [`super::cap`] answers 16 in an HQ and 40 in `hq_city` from
//! [`super::HQ_MAX_PEOPLE`] / [`super::HQ_MAX_CITY`] / [`super::HQ_CITY_ROOM`],
//! and [`super::room_gate`] answers "HQ presence lives in an HQ room" for an hq
//! frame outside an `hq_` room, BEFORE any room state is created.
//!
//! DIVERGENCES FROM PYTHON, beyond the shared list in `super`'s module doc:
//!   1. `a` (the walk flag) is kept as a RAW JSON value rather than an integer,
//!      because Python's membership test `a not in (0, 1, 2)` is `==` and
//!      `True == 1`, so `a: true` passes and is then re-sent verbatim as
//!      `true`. An `i64` would quietly turn that into `1`. See [`anim_ok`].
//!   2. hqpresence.py's `MAX_PEOPLE`, `CITY_ROOM` and `MAX_CITY` are NOT
//!      redeclared here: they already live in valley.rs beside [`super::cap`],
//!      which is their only caller, and two copies of a cap is how a cap drifts.
//!      valley.rs:203 says it means to hand them over; that is the integrator's
//!      move, not this file's.
//!   3. `_hq_tick_on`'s `v is None or room is None` half is
//!      [`super::ValleyHub::step`]'s job in this port, so [`step`] tests only
//!      what is left of that line: "nobody is in the HQ any more".
