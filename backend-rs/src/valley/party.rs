//! Party Mode (HQ 2.1): a playlist of the room's games with one combined score.
//!
//! Ported from backend/app/party.py in full, plus the party short-circuit at the
//! top of `valley.handle` (valley.py:1000) and `partymod.on_done` as `_flush`
//! calls it (valley.py:1610).
//!
//! Someone in a room starts a party; the room then plays Kart Racing, Platformer
//! Rush, Blaster Arena and Mini Golf in that order. Each finished game (its
//! "done" event, the same one the results are kept from) gives points by place,
//! 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1, and moves the party on to the next game. The Arena keeps
//! the score; the page only shows it. In memory, per room.
//!
//! AUDIENCE: `start` and `stop` and every `on_done` message go to the WHOLE
//! ROOM (`out.all`) -- party has no lobby at all, so there is no lobby audience;
//! `view` and the three errors answer the asking PERSON (see the divergence note
//! on [`op`]). `a_party_start_goes_to_the_whole_room` pins the broadcast.
//!
//! THIS FILE'S SHAPE IS NOT THE OTHER EIGHT ENGINES'. party is not in
//! [`super::GAMES`], has no lobby, needs no join, and its state is
//! MODULE-LEVEL ([`PARTIES`], Python's `_parties` at party.py:17) rather than a
//! [`super::RoomValley`] field, because Python keys it by room id in a global
//! dict and `handle` reaches it before any room state is created.
//!
//! The shared divergences are listed once at the top of `valley.rs`; this file
//! adds four of its own, each commented where it bites: the single-socket
//! audience ([`op`]), the monotonic clock ([`now`]), the unreachable
//! negative-place index ([`on_done`]) and golf's missing results branch
//! ([`golf_rows`]).
