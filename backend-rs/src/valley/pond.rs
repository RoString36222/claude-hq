//! The fishing pond: a shared dock where the SERVER picks every bite, times
//! every reel and scores every catch. A room goal, and a boss fish the whole
//! lobby reels in together.
//!
//! Ported from `backend/app/valley.py`: the catalogs (:84-101), `class Pond`
//! (:328-476), the pond tail of the join arm (:1036-1038), the pond arm of
//! `handle` (:1092-1105) and the pond branch of `_leave_lobby` (:1542-1545).
//! The shared divergences from Python are listed once in valley.rs's module
//! doc; this file notes only its own.
//!
//! AUDIENCE: almost everything here goes to [`Out::all`] -- the WHOLE ROOM,
//! including sockets that never joined the pond lobby, which is how a page shows
//! the dock to a bystander. Exactly three things go to the one socket:
//! the `cast` reply (it carries the anti-cheat `token`, which nobody else may
//! see), the `loot` from a chest, and the `pond` snapshot a joiner gets.
//! `..._goes_to_the_whole_room` below pins both halves.
//!
//! WHY THIS ENGINE EXISTS SERVER-SIDE AT ALL. The reel runs on the client, so
//! the client could claim anything. Three rules make a claim checkable, and
//! each rejects differently -- which matters, because turning a drop into an
//! error turns a flood guard into an error storm:
//!   - [`POND_OP_RATE`]: at most 6 line ops per second per player. Over that the
//!     frame is SILENTLY DROPPED -- no error, no state change, no answer at all
//!     (valley.py:1093-1094). `pull` is not a line op; it has its own
//!     [`PULL_RATE`], and over THAT limit it is likewise silently dropped.
//!   - [`MIN_REEL_MS`]: a landing sooner than bite + the rarity's floor is
//!     REFUSED with "too fast — that wasn't a real reel", and the line stays in
//!     the water so an honest client can land it a moment later.
//!   - [`HOOK_EARLY_MS`]: striking more than 250 ms before the bite is REFUSED
//!     with "not yet". A hook with the wrong token, or a second hook on a line
//!     already hooked, is answered with NOTHING (`hook` is cosmetic, so a
//!     stale frame is not worth an error).
//!
//! A `land` or `lose` naming a cast that is not yours, or a token that does not
//! match, is "no such cast" for `land` and silence for `lose`.
