//! The puzzle word race: the server holds a five-letter word and marks each
//! guess Wordle-style, privately.
//!
//! Ported from backend/app/valley.py: `RACE_GUESSES`/`RACE_SECS` (:103),
//! `RACE_WORDS` (:104-240), `mark` (:480-492), `class Race` (:494-540), the
//! `race` arm of `handle` (:1106-1110) and the join tail (:1039-1040). The
//! shared divergences from Python are listed once at the top of
//! `backend-rs/src/valley.rs`; this file adds none of its own.
//!
//! AUDIENCE. Everything the race says goes to [`To::All`], the WHOLE ROOM,
//! including sockets that never joined the race lobby -- `start`, `progress`,
//! `timeout` and `win`. The one exception is the `mark` itself, which goes to
//! the guesser's SOCKET alone, because the marks say which letters are in the
//! word and the room must not learn them (valley.py:533: the `progress` event
//! carries only a hit COUNT, "how close, never which letters").
//!
//! RACE HAS NO `_leave_lobby` BRANCH in the Python, so [`dropped`] does nothing
//! and a player who leaves keeps their guess count and their wins.

///     "alias" it answers `[near, hit, miss, hit, miss]` where Python answers
///     `[miss, hit, miss, hit, miss]`, because the leading 'a' would take the
