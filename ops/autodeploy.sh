# Pull-based continuous deployment for a self-hosted Arena.
#
# Checks the tracked branch for new commits and, if there are any, hands the
# release to ops/release.sh. Install with ops/install-autodeploy.sh. Logs to
# /var/log/arena-deploy.log.
#
# WHY THIS DELEGATES RATHER THAN DRIVING COMPOSE ITSELF
#
# It used to run `docker compose up -d --build` directly, and that was wrong in
# two ways once there were two implementations to choose between.
#
# 1. It shipped the wrong Arena. ops/release.sh records the implementation in
#    backend/.release.env and layers it with --env-file; a bare `docker compose`
#    reads only backend/.env, so it fell back to the defaults in
#    docker-compose.yml -- claude-hq-arena-py:local, built from
#    backend/Dockerfile. An Arena released as Rust came back as PYTHON on the
#    next push, and silently, because the Python Arena is healthy and nothing
#    alerts on which one is running.
#
# 2. Layering the env file would NOT have been enough, and would have been
#    worse. ARENA_APP_IMAGE in that file is a stamped tag (date + commit), and
#    `up --build` rebuilds whatever tag it is handed -- so a new commit would
#    have been built into the PREVIOUS release's tag. `release.sh status` would
#    then report a version that is not what is running, and `release.sh
#    rollback`, which restores a previous image by tag without rebuilding,
#    would restore a tag that now holds the newer code: a rollback that
#    silently does nothing.
#
# So the release belongs to one script. release.sh already pulls ff-only,
# refuses a dirty tree, gates on GitHub CI for the commit, stamps a fresh
# version, builds, migrates, waits for health, and on failure rolls back to the
# last good IMAGE. This script's job is only to notice there is something to
# deploy, and to keep a log of it.
