"""Everything the Rust Arena embeds at compile time must reach its Docker build.

`include_str!` is resolved by rustc, not by COPY, so a file that never arrives
fails the image build with "couldn't read ...: No such file or directory" from
the compiler -- a long way from the Dockerfile that caused it. The Rust image
also builds from the REPO ROOT with an ignore file that excludes everything and
then allowlists, so each embedded path needs a line in two places.

This test is here because golf and the creature duel were added with their data
files embedded the same way the other three games do it, and the image build was
the only thing that noticed.
